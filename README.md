# Wordle Solver
 This is basically a way to bruteforce your [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) guesses.  
 
 The way this program works is by taking input from the user about the characters they have guessed till now and based on the characters in the word and those not in the word this 
 generates a list of possible 5 letter words that satisfy the given characters.   
 
 Please note I have not added any functionality to tell the program the position of the letters.  
 List of words taken from [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)  
 P.S. Use this only when you are down to one guess and out of ideas. Otherwise it takes away the fun of the game ;)
